# Django e-commerce

Hi!

This is my project where I try to build e-commerce store.

The main features include:
  - user authentication,
  - cart system,
  - payment system,
  - user profile.

Currently trying to work on:
  - Debugging, there are a few small ones to tweak.
  - Rating system.
  - Frontend, because even though it works it doesn't look like, well... anything.
